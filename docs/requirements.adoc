== Why a new Framework for Bean validation?

While shopping for Bean validation frameworks, we stumbled-upon these well-known ones:

* https://www.baeldung.com/javax-validation[Java Bean validation]: This is only suitable for simple data validations
 like `@NotNull, @Min, @Max`.
* https://reflectoring.io/bean-validation-with-spring-boot/[Spring Bean validation]: It comes with a lot of *
 Spring-baggage* and works with Spring REST. But we predominantly use Connect framework on core.

== Problem with `@Annotation` based validators

Annotations are reflection based, and they create a lot of _runtime magic_. They are not bad in-general, but using them
for validations has these cons:

* It's difficult to debug as you wouldn't know which `AnnotationProcessor` handles which `@Annotation` unless the
 Javadoc writer of that Annotation is gracious to provide those details.
* You can't use a simple _⌘+Click_ to know what's going on underneath anymore.
* Annotations offer limited type-safety. It’s not possible to specify contextual requirements. Any annotation can go any
 type.
* Use of Reflections for Annotations also incur a runtime cost.
* Annotations are not testable.

Let's understand what kind of validations can services that belong to the same domain have.

== Service validations that belong to a Domain

We have a group of services under Payments-Platform domain, such as - Authorization, Capture, Refund, Void. Similar
service groups exist in Tax, Billing, Invoice domains too. All of these are REST-APIs that accept JSON payload. Services
that support _batch_ accept list of JSON sub-requests. A simplified version of a batch payload looks like this:

[source,jsonc]
----
[
  {
    "amount": 99,
    "accountId": "{{validAccountId}}",
    ...,
    "paymentMethod": {
        ...
    },
    ...
  },
  {
    "amount": 77,
    "accountId": "{{validAccountId}}",
    ...,
    "paymentMethod": {
        ...
    },
    ...
  }
]
----

This JSON structure gets marshaled into a _Bean/POJO_, which needs to be validated at the entry point of our application
layer. Since all services in this domain deal with similar fields, they have a lot of common fields
like `amount, accountId` etc., as well as common member nodes like `paymentMethod` in their structure. Based on the type
of field, there exist 4 kinds of validations. E.g.:

* _Common Validations_ - for common fields that exist across services, such as `amount`, `accountId`.
* _Nested Validations_ - for the member nodes like `paymentMethod` . These nested members share an Aggregation/Composition relationship with their container and have validations of their own. A service in the same
 domain may reuse this data-structure in its payload. Such service, along with its own validations, needs to execute all the validations of this nested member.

=== Requirements for Validation Orchestration

Now that we talked about types of validations, let's understand the requirements for validation orchestration (how to
execute these validations).

* *Share Validations:* Instead of rewriting, Share Common and Nested Validations among services that share payload
 structure.
* *2 Routes - 2 execution Strategies:* Our database entities can be CRUD through two routes i.e., *Connect* and **SObject**. 
They both need to be guarded with Validations. But the tricky part is - the Connect-route needs to _fail-fast_, while the SObject needs _error-accumulation_.
* *Configure Validation Order for Fail-fast:* A way to configure Cheaper validations first and Costlier later. Costlier
 validations can include Effectful validations, so we need to fail-fast and avoid unnecessary DB calls.
* *Partial failures for Batch APIs:* An aggregated error response for failed sub-requests can only be sent after
 valid requests are processed through multiple layers of the application. We have to hold on to the invalid
 sub-requests till the end and skip them from processing.
* *Meta-requirements:*
** Accommodate a century of validations across a domain
** Unit testability for Validations
** No compromise on Performance
