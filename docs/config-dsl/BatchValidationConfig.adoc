As the name indicates, use this to configure validation requirements for a data-structure that exists in a _Collection_ or a _Batch_, say `List<ValidatableT>`.
But why a new DSL, can't we just use `ValidationConfig` DSL and loop through each item and validate? `BatchValidationConfig` is a superset of `ValidationConfig`. 
We can configure more than just validations and required fields/Ids. You can configure specifications that need context of the entire Batch.
