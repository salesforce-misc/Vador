== Stability

* It‚Äôs our responsibility to address all the edge cases and automate them thoroughly, for various types of POJOs.
* We take code-quality & security seriously!
** ~100 unit tests currently guarding this, with a test coverage of `81.9%`
* *0 bugs* and *no perf impact* reported by any of the consumer teams till now.

== Long Term Support

* This library is currently being supported by *Rev-Delphinus*
* We added a lot of documentation with runnable examples (in-fact each unit test in the repo is a runnable example). 
We are committed to keep iterating and improving it. 
* We are happy to provide 1:1 support, until the documentation is comprehensive.
* Vador is under active development. We have a *Healthy backlog* of features and are eager to take-up more feature requests.
