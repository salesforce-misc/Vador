== Readability

We don't need analogies to stress on how important readability is and how Config is more readable than code with nested `if/else/for`.

== Maintainability 

Strips out a lot of the code/logic to maintain.

== Complexity 

* No branching => No Cyclomatic complexity/Cognitive complexity.
* It abstracts away all the implementation complexity.
* Saves a lot of Man hours while writing and _10X_ more while reading.
* Eliminates the need to spike on your validation strategy/design.

TIP: An *8-pointer* Story for Free ü§ë

== Testability 

Think of writing config as fill in the blanks for well-tested algorithm templates, so you don't need to write any code, which implies no need to write any tests.

NOTE: You can always test your config (to double-check if right values are provided), but no need to re-test the already well-tested implementation.

== Flexibility 

* This is decoupled from the API orchestration method. For example, currently it's *Fail-Fast for Any*.
But if you want to migrate to Fail-Fast for each item (to handle partial failures) or if you have another route like SObject where you need to accumulate all errors, that's as simple as calling a different API method without changing anything else.
* If you wish to skip some validations or add new validations depending on the route, you can have different configs instances for different routes.

== Extensibility

* Config can easily be modified or extended if your Bean's data-structure changes, with new fields being added or removed.
* Config can easily catch up, even when your service migrates from non-batch to batch mode.

== Re-usability

Config is mapped to a data structure.
Which means, if the validation requirements are same, you can *reuse* the config everywhere the data-structure is used, say in a different API. 
Even if the data-structure (member) is nested inside another bean (container), the container bean can reuse all the validations of its member without rewriting.

== Learning Curve

Use of same Config pattern through-out, with self-explaining DSL methods to drive your development.
This keeps the scope and slope of your learning curve required, low.
