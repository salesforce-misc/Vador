== Translate your Spike doc to Type-safe code (line-to-line)!

The idea is, just take your validation requirements from the spike doc and describe them in a Type-safe format through a `Config`.
Vador does the rest!

== Configure your validation requirements

Think of it as the entity XML we write, where we don't write the actual DDL, but a definition of it in XML, and platform takes care of the rest.
We do something similar here, just that we use Java instead of XML for more data-type safety.

== Config Types we use for this flow
