This execution strategy lets you run validations for your batch data structure
and _fail-fast_ on the first failure for _any_ member in the batch i.e.,
if a member fails one of the validations, it stops running further validations on the rest of the members in the batch.

== Params

[cols="1,1,1,3"]
|===
|Param |Data type |Required? |Description

|`validatables`
|`List<ValidatableT>`
|Yes
|List of POJO/Beans under validation

|`pairForInvalidMapper`
|`(ValidatableT) -> PairT`
|Yes
|Function (mostly a getter) whose return value can be used as an identifier to identify the first failed member in `validatables`.  

|`batchValidationConfig`
|`BatchValidationConfig`
|Yes
|Config for validation

|`failureForNullValidatable`
|`FailureT`
|No
|Failure to return if a member in `validatables` passed is `null`

|`throwableMapper`
|`(Throwable) -> FailureT?`
|No
|xref:../../../README.adoc#_what_if_there_is_an_exception_during_execution[Refer this section]

|===

== Return

`Optional<Tuple2<PairT, FailureT>>` - First failure for any member paired with the identifier of the failed member. 
If all members pass all validations, `Optional.empty()` shall be returned.
