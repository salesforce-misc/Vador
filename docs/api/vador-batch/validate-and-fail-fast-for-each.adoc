This execution strategy lets you run validations for your batch data structure
and _fail-fast_ on the first failure for _each_ member in the batch i.e.,
if a member fails one of the validations,
it stops running further validations on that member and moves on to the next member in the batch.

== Return

You can read more about `Either` data type https://docs.vavr.io/#_either[here].

`List<Either<FailureT, ValidatableT>>` - One entry per member in the same order of `validatables`. 
If the member passes all validations,
the result holds the validatable that is validated in the right state `Either.right(Validatable)`. 
Otherwise, the result will be `Either.left(Failure)`, holding the first failure for that validatable.
