[#_versioning_strategy]
== Versioning Strategy

====
<A>.<B>.<C>
====

* A = We broke something on purpose (Breaking API change)
* B = Profit (Feature / Improvement)
* C = We broke something by accident (Bug)

== Source-code Setup

=== Install Java 11

* It needs JDK 11 installed in your system. I recommend doing it via https://sdkman.io/install[SDKMAN]. After you install SDKMAN, run `sdk list java` -> Pick Identifier for your favorite java dist -> Run `sdk install java <Identifier-you-picked>  to install Java.

=== Build with Gradle

* This is a simple Gradle project and has its own Gradle wrapper. So nothing to install. Just run this command

CAUTION: You may see some build errors related to the delombok task.
They shouldn't fail your build, and you may ignore them.
They will be addressed once Kotlin Lombok compiler supports Lombok `@Builders`.
There is an https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-46959[Active Issue] filed for this as well.

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew clean build
----

TIP: You *don't* need a local Gradle installation as the `gradlew` (Gradle wrapper) takes care of everything. But if you wish to install gradle locally, the recommendation is to  do it via https://sdkman.io/install[SDKMAN]. After you install SDKMAN, run `sdk install gradle` to install Gradle

* For source code navigation, you need to have https://projectlombok.org/[*Lombok*] plugin, which is used to generate boilerplate code.
There are plugins available for all popular IDEs, which you need to install.
The latest version of the plugin should work.
* You can run/debug the existing unit tests or write your own to play with Vador.

=== Kotlin

* The code-base is a mix of Java and Kotlin. If you're a Java developer and new to Kotlin, don't worry, Kotlin is a JVM language and can be used anywhere Java is used.
In fact, it has got the reputation of *"Better Java!"*.
* A typical Java developer can ramp up on Kotlin in less than a week.
This free-course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/kotlin-for-java-developers[*Kotlin for Java Developers | Coursera*] can help catalyze your ramp-up.
* If you use Intellij, Kotlin plugin comes bundled. Similar development aids should be present for other code editors too.

== Code Formatting

* This repo uses https://github.com/diffplug/spotless[*Spotless*] for formatting files, as this repo has code from more than one programming language.
* Please run `./gradlew spotlessApply` before check-in to fix any formatting errors.

TIP: If you're on Intellij, replace your kbd:[Cmd+Shift+L] habit with kbd:[Ctrl]-kbd:[Ctrl] and run `gradle spotlessApply` (Or the respective action if you're on Eclipse).
It may be slow for the first run, but later runs should be faster.

== Manual publishing

In link:build.gradle.kts[], follow the <<_versioning_strategy,Versioning Strategy>>

* Follow the <<_versioning_strategy,Versioning Strategy>> to increment version link:buildSrc/{sourcedir}/Config.kt[here]
** For SNAPSHOT releases, add a `-SNAPSHOT` at the end of version number
* Run this command to publish it to Nexus:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew publishToSonatype closeAndReleaseSonatypeStagingRepository -Dorg.gradle.parallel=false --no-configuration-cache
